basic rps game

1. Basic outline of what i think at first using comments
2. Finished template function of getComputerChoice()
3. Finished template function of playRound()
4. game() kind of completed
5. **console.log(game()) used 5 times to simulate 5 rounds
6. Realised that i am using the same result which is wrong.
7. Asked chatgpt and it moved my line 42-44 to game()
8. I keep forgetting that a function without a loop only does the thing 1 time.
